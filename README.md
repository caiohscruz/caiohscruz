## :vulcan_salute:Hello World! My name is Caio Henrique...

I have professional experience developing, maintaining and evolving platforms built with .NET Framework and .NET Core on the Backend and Angular, AngularJS or VueJs on the Frontend. I am also very familiar with AWS and Azure Cloud, having worked with, but not only, EC2, S3, Lambda and SQS from the former and Functions, Logic Apps, Blob Storage, and App Insight from the letter.  By the way, I'm AWS Cloud Pratictioner certified and I'm interested in other certifications, inclusive from Azure.

I enjoy working in agile teams, collaborating with product owners, developers, and testers to deliver high-quality software solutions – scalability, security, and usability are always on the radar. I also participate in brainstorming sessions to ensure understanding and clarity of functional and technical requirements - I'm one of those who doesn't miss the opportunity to use white boards and draw up diagrams to clarify things. I am always eager to learn new things and explore new challenges.

I had contact with some technology topics from an early age, my father works in the area, eventually he showed me one thing or another, and I had contact with databases, programming logic and Pascal in high school. My interest in the area intensified around 2015, when I started studying Computer Systems at the Fluminense Federal University (UFF). I studied technology all these years for pleasure, I had a stable job in public administration, but in 2021, analyzing the political and economic scenario, I ended up deciding to migrate to another area and work in IT. I have to say that I am quite satisfied with this choice.
