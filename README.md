I have a degree in Computer Systems, but I haven't had the opportunity to work in the area yet. For a long time I was used to working only in the administrative area of the government, mainly because of "stability", but that doesn't suit me anymore. I miss the challenges and the excitement involved in solving problems, the lack of autonomy in the public sector, the rigid procedures and the extremely monotonous routine are doing me a lot of harm.

During my studies, I had contact with several technologies and languages, I would highlight PHP, PHPMyAdmin, Java, MySQL, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and Paschal. Now, thinking about work in the IT area, I can't think of what to focus on yet. 

I would be immensely grateful if you, who work in the field, could send me a message talking briefly about what you do, about the languages you use, about strategies to enter the job market. I feel very insecure, I'm used to conquering things through exams, *I go there, take a test and it's over*. This message can help me find a North, it can quiet my little heart and clear my mind.
