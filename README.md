## :vulcan_salute:Hello World! My name is Caio Henrique...

My history with programming is more than 7 years old.

In FrontEnd, I started with pure PHP and Javascript, today I have proficiency to work with AngularJs, "the old one", VueJs and Asp.Net Mvc.

On the backend, I started with Java, today I work comfortably with .Net Core and NodeJs. Entity Framework, LINQ, Express, Sequelize, Knex, Mongoose, Axios, these tools and many others are part of my repertoire.

I've worked with relational and non-relational databases, especially SQL Server, MySql, Oracle and MongoDb.

I am very familiar with the AWS platform, having experience with services like EC2, S3, Lambda, Route53, load balancing, SQS... I also know about Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Azure Pipelines and so on.

:books: I have focused my studies so far to improve myself on design patterns, TDD, architectural patterns and best practices for software development, from Clean Code to software engineering topics, which can be seen in my most recent publications on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/caiohscruz/). :books:

:thought_balloon: I'm starting now, however, to consider directing my studies to prepare myself for Web3.0, I need to deepen my knowledge about the RPC protocol, Websockets, Pub-Sub design pattern and maybe blockchains, among many other things obviously. :thought_balloon:

:mortar_board: I have an Associate Degree in Computer Systems from UFF (2015-2018) and post graduate degree is in my plans, as well as some certifications, but I have other priorities for my budget at the moment. :mortar_board:

The projects I have worked on professionally are private, but some study projects are available here. I occasionally consult them to retrieve some ideas or solutions.
