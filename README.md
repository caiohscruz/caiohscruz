## :vulcan_salute:Hello World! My name is Caio Henrique...

 :mortar_board: **Technologist in Computer Systems at Universidade Federal Fluminense**:mortar_board: 

 :briefcase: **Jr Analyst / FullStack Developer at Anima Educação** :briefcase:
 
 :thought_balloon: I'm studying some possibilities for postgraduate courses, I'm between a course in "Cloud and Edge Computing" and another in "Artificial Intelligence and Data Science". :thought_balloon:
 
:facepunch: In the second half of last year, I participated in a Full Stack Developer training (100h) by Gama Academy, the [AnimaTECH](https://animatech.corporate.gama.academy/). Among the contents of the program, I would point out that we were introduced to AspNET Core - with Entity Framework, migrations, Rest API -, to VueJS, to the concepts of DevOps and Tests. After this training, I was selected to work at Ânima Educação. :facepunch:

:books: **In addition to being thinking about advancing in academic studies, with a postgraduate degree, I am evaluating the options of open courses that I have access to to start in the coming weeks. I stayed away from here because I'm adjusting to the new job, the new routine, the new house and I also got married recently, which adds a little more mental load to process. I was absent from here, but I didn't stop studying, I attended some classes here and there and I also started some readings.** :books:  

:v: **Today, if someone asked me to recommend a course, I would recommend the [NodeJS training](https://www.udemy.com/course/formacao-nodejs/) course without thinking twice. I really liked this course, it gave me perspective, I was able to make correlations with what I learned in college and in other free courses. This course works not only with the Backend in NodeJS, it has a presentation to the FrontEnd with VueJS.** :v:

:cat: I have three cats: Atreus, Vanessinha and Tigrinho :cat:

:tada:I like watching animes, playing video games, trekking, dancing at raves, staying in my corner reading and hanging out with friends.:tada:

I have more than six years of experience in public administration, and I took my first steps as a developer at the end of last year. I had a lot of internal resistance to make this career transition, and now I'm very happy that I had that courage.

The universitary course provided general bases of operating systems, networks, construction of web pages ( HTML | CSS | Javascript), web programming (PHP), graphical interfaces (Lazarus | Paschal), information modeling, SGBDs (MySQL), POO (Java), software engineering, systems analysis and more.

From recent studyies I learned about REST APIs ( Axious | JWT | Cors ), ORM ( Entity - ASP.NET | JPA - JAVA | Sequelize - Javascript ), AJAX, NodeJS ( express | Dotenv | TinyMCE | bcryptjs | slugify | express-session | EJS | html-pdf | fs )
